Предлагаемый вам учебник является продолжением курса \"Алгебра и начала анализа\" для 10 класса естественноматематического направления.  \\nВ 11 классе вы будете изучать такие понятия как первообразная, неопределенный и определенный интегралы, корень п-й степени, степень с рациональным и иррациональным показателями, логарифм, степенная, показательная и логарифмическая функции, комплексные числа, дифференциальное уравнение, дискретные и интервальные вариационные ряды. Вы научитесь решать иррациональные, показательные, логарифмические уравнения, неравенства и их системы, дифференциальные уравнения, находить производные степенной, показательной и логарифмической функций.  \\nВы также ознакомитесь с приложениями интеграла при вычислении площадей плоских фигур и объемов тел.  \\nУчебник состоит из 8 глав, 28 параграфов.\\nВ каждом параграфе при изложении текста программного материала даны вопросы и задания для самостоятельного выполнения учащимися.  \\nПри работе с учебником вам необходимо обратить внимание на вопросы, предлагаемые перед упражнениями каждого параграфа. Кроме этого, главы учебника завершаются тестовыми заданиями, заданиями по математической грамотности.  \\nЧтобы помочь вам в работе с учебником, к каждой теме указаны опорные понятия, способы решения задач.  \\nСистема заданий по каждой теме состоит из трех групп:\\nА - обязательные задания для всех учащихся;\\nВ - задания средней сложности;\\nC - задания повышенной трудности.\\nКроме этого, в учебник включены задания со знаком*. Эти задания рекомендуются учащимся, которые имеют высокий уровень математической подготовки.  \\nОвладев навыками решений заданий группы А, нужно перейти к решению заданий группы В, и если после этого у вас появился интерес к дальнейшему повышению своих знаний, то по своему желанию вы можете работать над решениями отдельных заданий из группы С. Освоив навыки решения заданий группы С, вы, безусловно, развиваете свои математические способности.  \\nТакже в учебнике даны упражнения для повторения курса алгебры и начала анализа $10-11$ классов.  \\nВ конце учебника имеется глоссарий.\\nДля проверки правильности решений упражнений в конце учебника даны ответы.  \\n---'),\n",

Если для любого $x$ из множества $X$ выполняется равентво $F^{\\\\prime}(x)=f(x)$, то функиию $F(x)$ называют первообразной для функции $f(x)$ на данном множестве.  \\nПервообразная функции, также как и сама функция, может быть рассмотрена на множестве всех действительных чисел или на определенном промежутке или интервале.  \\nВ приведенном выше примере функция $F(x)=x^{4}$ является первообразной для функции $f(x)=4 x^{3}$ на множестве $(-\\\\infty ;+\\\\infty)$, т. е. на всей числовой оси.  \\nПРИМЕР  \\n1.

Однако в каждом из промежутков $(-\\\\infty ; 0)$ и $(0 ;+\\\\infty)$ функция $F(x)$ является первообразной для $f(x)$.  \\nНетрудно заметить, что первообразная функции не единственна, их бесчисленное множество. Например, для функции $f(x)=4 x^{3}$ первообразной функцией является не только $F(x)=x^{4}$, но и $G(x)=x^{4}-5$; $P(x)=x^{4}+\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}}{2} ; Q(x)=x^{4}+7$ и т. д., так как производная каждой из этих функций равна $4 x^{3}$. Другими словами, они отличаются друг от друга только на постоянное число, производная которого равна нулю.  \\nТеорема. Если на каком-то промежутке функиии $F(x)$ и $\\\\Phi(x)$ явля ются первообразными для одной и той же функиии $f(x)$, то на этом промежутке они отличаются друг от друга только на постоянное число.  \\nДоказательство.

Подставив данное значение в равенство ( $\\\\left.{ }^{( }\\\\right)$имеем  \\n$$\\n\\\\Phi(x)=F(x)+C\\n$$  \\nТаким образом, если $F^{\\\\prime}(x)=f(x)$ и $C$ - любое постоянное число, тогда выражение $F(x)+C$ также будет первообразным для функции $f(x)$.  \\nРавенство $\\\\Phi(x)=F(x)+C$ выражает основное свойство первообразной.  \\nВы узнаете геометрический смысл первообразной.  \\nПусть постоянная $C$ из формулы (1) будет равна нулю.

В отличие от производных интеграл от элементарных функций не всегда является элементарной функцией. Например, интегралы $\\\\int \\\\cos x d x, \\\\int x^{5} d x$ табличные, тогда как интеграл $\\\\int \\\\frac{\\\\cos x}{x} d x$ не выражается через элементарные функции.  \\nПусть функции $u=f(x), v=g(x), u^{\\\\prime}=f^{\\\\prime}(x)$ и $v^{\\\\prime}=g^{\\\\prime}(x)$ непрерывны на числовом промежутке $[a ; b]$.  \\nФормула интегрирования по частям для неопределенного интеграла имеет вид:  \\n$$\\n\\\\int u d v=u v-\\\\int v d u\\n$$  \\nДоказательство. Рассмотрим формулу для нахождения производной произведения $(u v)^{\\\\prime}=u v^{\\\\prime}+v u^{\\\\prime}$ и проинтегрируем обе части этого равенства. Получим: $\\\\int(u v)^{\\\\prime} d x=\\\\int\\\\left(u v^{\\\\prime}+v u^{\\\\prime}\\\\right) d x$. Отсюда $u v+C=$ $=\\\\int\\\\left(u v^{\\\\prime}+v u^{\\\\prime}\\\\right) d x$ или $u v+C=\\\\int u v^{\\\\prime} d x+\\\\int v u^{\\\\prime} d x$. Поскольку $v^{\\\\prime} d x=d v$ и $u^{\\\\prime} d x=d u$, то получим $u v+C=\\\\int u d v+\\\\int v d u$ или $\\\\int u d v=u v-\\\\int v d u+C$.  \\nФормула (1) называется формулой интегрирования по частям. При ее применении подынтегральная функция разлагается на два множите-  \\n---  \\nля $u$ и $v^{\\\\prime}$, из которых один множитель дифференцируется, а второй интегрируется, т. е. переходим к интегралу, у которого вместо $u$ стоит $u^{\\\\prime}$, а вместо $v^{\\\\prime}$ стоит $v$. После такого преобразования иногда получается табличный интеграл, или более простой интеграл, чем исходный.  \\nФормула интегрирования по частям применяется во многих случаях, например, интегралы вида: $\\\\int P_{n}(x) \\\\sin a x d x, \\\\int P_{n}(x) \\\\cos a x d x$, $\\\\int P_{n}(x) \\\\arcsin a x d x, \\\\int P_{n}(x) \\\\arccos a x d x, \\\\int P_{n}(x) \\\\operatorname{arctg} a x d x$.  \\nПричем, при нахождении $\\\\int P_{n}(x) \\\\sin a x d x$ или $\\\\int P_{n}(x) \\\\cos a x d x$ в качестве $u$ берем многочлен $P_{n}(x)$, тогда соответственно получаем $d v=\\\\cos a x d x$ или $d v=\\\\sin a x d x$ и формула интегрирования по частям применяется $n$ раз.  \\nПри нахождении интегралов вида $\\\\int P_{n}(x) \\\\arcsin a x d x, \\\\int P_{n}(x) \\\\arccos a x d x$, $\\\\int P_{n}(x) \\\\operatorname{arctg} a x d x$ в качестве $u$ берем $\\\\arcsin a x$, или $\\\\arccos a x$, или $\\\\operatorname{arctg} a x$, тогда $d v=P_{n}(x) d x$, и значит $v=P_{n+1}(x)$.  \\n3.

Если через эту точку $x$ провести плоскость, перпендикулярную оси $O x$, то она пересечет данное тело вращения по кругу (т. е. в сечении образуется круг).

Значит, если $\\\\Delta x$ стремится к нулю, то $Q\\\\left(x_{0}+\\\\Delta x\\\\right)$ стремится к $Q\\\\left(x_{0}\\\\right)$, а следовательно $\\\\frac{V\\\\left(x_{0}+\\\\Delta x\\\\right)-V\\\\left(x_{0}\\\\right)}{\\\\Delta x}$ стремится к $Q\\\\left(x_{0}\\\\right)$  \\n---  \\nпри $\\\\Delta x \\\\rightarrow 0$.

Так, в Древней Греции и Риме ученые-математики интересовались решением задач на нахождение квадратур произвольной плоской фигуры (т. е. вычисление площадей способом построения равновеликого ей квадрата), а также кубатур (т. е. вычисление объемов в кубических единицах способом построения равноемкого ему куба) произвольного тела. Их деятельность была связана с применением так называемого метода исчерпывания, который был предложен Евдоксом Книдским (ок. 408 - ок. 355 до н.э.). Применяя этот метод Евдокс доказал, например, что площади двух кругов относятся как квадраты их диаметров, а объем конуса равен $\\\\frac{1}{3}$ объема цилиндра, имеющего такие же основание и высоту.  \\nВ своем сочинении \"Квадратура параболы\" Архимед, усовершенствовав метод Евдокса, вывел формулу площади круга. Суть метода Архимеда заключается в следующем:  \\n1) доказывается, что площадь круга меньше площади любого описанного около него правильного многоугольника, но больше площади любого вписанного в него правильного многоугольника;\\n2) доказывается, что при неограниченном удвоении числа сторон, описанных около круга и вписанных в круг правильных многоугольников разность их площадей становится бесконечно малой величиной (приближается к нулю);\\n3) за величину площади круга берется значение, к которому стремится величина площади описанного около него (или вписанного в круг) правильного многоугольника при неограниченном удвоении числа его сторон.  \\nСам символ интеграла $\\\\int$ введен Г. Лейбницем ( 1675 г.), он напоминает измененный вид начальной латинской буквы $S$ в слове summa. Слово интеграл впервые использовано Я. Бернулли ( 1690 г.). Это слово, видимо, происходит от латинского слова integro, которое переводится как \"приводить в прежнее состояние, восстанавливать\". Возможно, этот термин происходит от слова integer, которое означает \"целый\".  \\n## ОПОРНЫЕ ПОНЯТИЯ ДЛЯ ОВЛАДЕНИЯ НОВЫМИ ЗНАНИЯМИ  \\nВарианта, вариационный ряд, ряд распределения, полигон, полигон частот.  \\n---'),\n",

Однако одна из основных задач математической статистики состоит в надлежащей обработке полученной информации, тогда и остальные задачи достижимы.  \\nПорядок преобразования первоначально полученной информации примерно следующий:  \\n- данные измерений (опыта) упорядочивают и группируют;\\n- после группировки составляют таблицы измерений данных;\\n- по таблице распределения можно построить графики распределения данных;\\n- составляют своего рода паспорт данного измерения, в котором собрано небольшое количество основных числовых характеристик полученных измерений.  \\nНа практике реализация этих шагов проводится с помощью одной из компьютерных программ обработки и анализа данных. Например, \"MatLab\", \"Microsoft Excel\", \"Statistica\".  \\nИтак, пусть изучаются некоторые объекты и их свойства, для это проводится достаточно большое количество испытаний (измерений).  \\nГенеральной совокупностью называется совокупность всех подлежащих изучению объектов или возможных результатов всех наблюдений, производимых в одинаковых условиях над одним объектом.  \\nВыборочной совокупностью или выборкой называется совокупность объектов или результатов наблюдения над объектом, отобранных случайным образом из генеральной совокупности.  \\nОбъемом выборки называется число объектов или наблюдений в выборке.  \\n---  \\nЗначения выборки называют наблюдаемьли значениями случайной величины $X$.  \\nДля получения достоверных и надежных выводов выборка должна быть достаточно представительной по объему.

Для расчетов величины интервала используется формула:  \\n$$\\ni=\\\\frac{x_{\\\\max }-x_{\\\\min }}{n}\\n$$  \\nгде $i$ - величина или длина интервала; $x_{\\\\max }$ - максимальное значение; $x_{\\\\text {min }}$ - минимальное значение; $n$ - требуемое число групп по условию задачи.  \\nПервый интервал начинают строить от минимального значения, к нему добавляется величина интервала и получается верхняя граница первого интервала.

Это равенство верно, поскольку, если рассмотрим нахождение производной функции $f(x)=x$, то имеем: $f(x)=x, f(x+\\\\Delta x)=x+\\\\Delta x$, $\\\\Delta y=f(x+\\\\Delta x)-f(x)=(x+\\\\Delta x)-x=\\\\Delta x$.  \\nСледовательно, $\\\\frac{\\\\Delta y}{\\\\Delta x}=1$, откуда вытекает, что $y^{\\\\prime}=\\\\lim _{\\\\Delta x \\\\rightarrow 0} \\\\frac{\\\\Delta y}{\\\\Delta x}=\\\\lim _{\\\\Delta x \\\\rightarrow 0} 1=1$. Значит, при $n=1$ формула (1) верна.\\n2) Предположим, что она верна при $n=k$, т. е. $\\\\left(x^{k}\\\\right)^{\\\\prime}=k x^{k-1}$.\\n3) Докажем, что она верна и при $n=k+1$, т. е. $\\\\left(x^{k+1}\\\\right)^{\\\\prime}=(k+1) x^{k}$. Для этого представим $x^{k+1}$ в виде произведения ( $x^{k} \\\\cdot x$ ), и используем правило дифференцирования произведения. Тогда:  \\n$$\\n\\\\left(x^{k+1}\\\\right)^{\\\\prime}=\\\\left(x^{k} \\\\cdot x\\\\right)^{\\\\prime}=\\\\left(x^{k}\\\\right)^{\\\\prime} \\\\cdot x+x^{k} \\\\cdot(x)^{\\\\prime}\\n$$  \\nУчитывая предположение о том, что $\\\\left(x^{k}\\\\right)^{\\\\prime}=k x^{k-1}$, а также $x^{\\\\prime}=1$, получим: $\\\\left(x^{k+1}\\\\right)^{\\\\prime}=k x^{k-1} \\\\cdot x+x^{k} \\\\cdot 1=(k+1) x^{k}$, т. е. формула (1) верна при $n=k+1$.  \\nСледовательно, формула (1) верна для любого целого числа $n$.  \\n---  \\nТакже для любого действительного числа $\\\\alpha$ производная степенной функции $y=x^{\\\\alpha}$ находится по формуле:  \\n$$\\n\\\\left(x^{\\\\alpha}\\\\right)^{\\\\prime}=\\\\alpha x^{\\\\alpha-1}\\n$$'),\n",

Иррациональныл уравнениеж называется уравнение, содержащее неизвестное под знаком радикала, или под знаком возведения в дробную степень.  \\nТак, иррациональными являются уравнения:  \\n$$\\n\\\\begin{array}{ll}\\n\\\\sqrt{x+3}=2 x-1 ; & \\\\sqrt{x-1}-12 \\\\sqrt[3]{x}=3 \\\\\\\\\\n2 x^{\\\\frac{1}{3}}-5=0 ; & (2 x-x)^{\\\\frac{1}{3}}=(x+6)^{\\\\frac{1}{4}}+7 x\\n\\\\end{array}\\n$$  \\nДля того, чтобы решить иррациональное уравнение, вначале нужно обратить внимание на вид данного уравнения. Это позволяет выяснить, есть ли смысл решать уравнение вообще, а если да, то каким способом. К примеру, нет смысла приступать к решению уравнения $\\\\sqrt[4]{x+3}=-2$, так как значение арифметического корня не может быть отрицательным числом.  \\nВы расширите знания по нахождению области допустимых значений переменной.\\nПри решении иррациональных уравнений корни (радикалы), входящие в уравнения, всегда рассматриваются как арифметические корни. Для выяснения этого факта нужно определить ОДЗ переменной, содержащейся под знаком корня.  \\nВы научитесь решать иррациональные уравнения методом возведения обеих частей уравнения в $n$-ю степень.  \\nОбщий метод решения иррациональных уравнений заключается в следующем:  \\n---  \\na) если иррациональное уравнение содержит только один радикал, то нужно преобразовать уравнение так, чтобы в одной его части оказался только этот радикал. Затем обе части уравнения возводят в одну и ту же степень, чтобы получилось рациональное уравнение;\\nб) если в иррациональном уравнении содержится два или более радикала, то сначала изолируется один из радикалов, затем обе части уравнения возводят в одну и ту же степень и повторяют операцию возведения в степень до тех пор, пока не получится рациональное уравнение.  \\nПри возведении обеих частей уравнения в одну и ту же степень иногда получается уравнение, не равносильное данному. Поэтому необходимо проверить, удовлетворяют или не удовлетворяют найденные значения переменной искомому уравнению. Проверка является составной частью решения, поскольку некоторые найденные значения переменной могут не удовлетворять исходному уравнению.  \\nТакие значения переменной называют посторонними корнями.\\nРассмотрим примеры решения иррациональных уравнений.'),\n",

Поэтому данное неравенство предварительно запишем в следующем виде $\\\\sqrt{5\\\\left(x^{2}+2 x\\\\right)+1}>7-$ $-\\\\left(x^{2}+2 x\\\\right)$ и введем обозначение: $y=x^{2}+2 x$. Тогда последнее неравенство примет вид $\\\\sqrt{5 y+1}>7-y$.  \\nПрименяя соотношение (8) из последнего неравенства получим две системы неравенств:  \\n1) $\\\\left\\\\{\\\\begin{array}{l}5 y+1 \\\\geqslant 0, \\\\\\\\ 7-y<0\\\\end{array}\\\\right.$ или $\\\\left\\\\{\\\\begin{array}{l}5 y \\\\geqslant-1, \\\\\\\\ y>7\\\\end{array}\\\\right.$ или $\\\\left\\\\{\\\\begin{array}{l}y \\\\geqslant-\\\\frac{1}{5}, \\\\\\\\ y>7 .\\\\end{array}\\\\right.$  \\nОтсюда получим $y>7$. Решением системы неравенств является промежуток $(7 ;+\\\\infty)$.\\n2) $\\\\left\\\\{\\\\begin{array}{l}7-y \\\\geqslant 0, \\\\\\\\ 5 y+1>(7-y)^{2}\\\\end{array}\\\\right.$ или $\\\\left\\\\{\\\\begin{array}{l}y<7, \\\\\\\\ y^{2}-19 y+48<0\\\\end{array}\\\\right.$ или  \\n$$\\n\\\\left\\\\{\\\\begin{array}{l}\\ny<7, \\\\\\\\\\n(y-3)(y-16)<0\\n\\\\end{array}\\\\right. \\\\text { или }\\\\left\\\\{\\\\begin{array}{l}\\ny<7, \\\\\\\\\\n3<y<16 .\\n\\\\end{array}\\\\right.\\n$$  \\nМножеством решений системы неравенств будет промежуток (3; 7] (рис. 48). Следовательно, объединив решения двух этих систем, имеем $y>3$.  \\n---  \\nПодставив вместо $y$ его обозначение $x^{2}+2 x$, имеем: $x^{2}+2 x>3$. Решим последнее неравенство: $x^{2}+2 x-3>0$ или $(x-1)(x+3)>0$. Решением неравенства является множество $(-\\\\infty ;-3) \\\\cup(1 ;+\\\\infty)$ (рис. 49).\\n![[алгебра 11 рус_p124_img68.jpeg]]  \\nРис. 48\\n![[алгебра 11 рус_p124_img69.jpeg]]  \\nРис. 49  \\nВторой способ. Умножим обе части неравенства $\\\\sqrt{5 x^{2}+10 x+1}>7-2 x-x^{2}$ на число $5>0$, тогда получим равносильное неравенство $5 \\\\sqrt{5 x^{2}+10 x+1}>35-$ $-5 x^{2}-10 x$. Полученное неравенство запишем в виде:  \\n$$\\n5 \\\\sqrt{5 x^{2}+10 x+1}>36-\\\\left(5 x^{2}+10 x+1\\\\right)\\n$$  \\nВведем новую переменную: $\\\\sqrt{5 x^{2}+10 x+1}=a(a>0)$. Тогда последнее неравенство примет вид: $5 a>36-a^{2}$ или $a^{2}+5 a-36>0$. Решением неравенства является множество $(-\\\\infty ;-9) \\\\cup(4 ;+\\\\infty)$.  \\nТак как $a>0$, то рассмотрим только множество $(4 ;+\\\\infty)$. Итак $a>4$, значит, $\\\\sqrt{5 x^{2}+10 x+1}>4$. Возведем обе части неравенства в квадрат, получим: $5 x^{2}+10 x+1>16$ или $5 x^{2}+10 x-15>0$. Сократим полученное неравенство на 5 . $x^{2}+2 x-3>0$, решением этого неравенства является множество $(-\\\\infty ;-3) \\\\cup(1 ;+\\\\infty)$.  \\nОтвет: $(-\\\\infty ;-3) \\\\cup(1 ;+\\\\infty)$.  \\n7. Докажем неравенство $\\\\frac{x+y}{2}>\\\\sqrt{x y}$, где $x>0, y>0$.  \\nДоказательство. Первый способ. Сумму $x+y$ преобразуем следующим образом:  \\n$$\\nx+y=(\\\\sqrt{x})^{2}+(\\\\sqrt{y})^{2}-2 \\\\sqrt{x} \\\\sqrt{y}+2 \\\\sqrt{x y}=(\\\\sqrt{x}-\\\\sqrt{y})^{2}+2 \\\\sqrt{x y}\\n$$  \\nТогда $\\\\frac{x+y}{2}=\\\\frac{(\\\\sqrt{x}-\\\\sqrt{y})^{2}+2 \\\\sqrt{x y}}{2}=\\\\frac{1}{2}(\\\\sqrt{x}-\\\\sqrt{y})^{2}+\\\\sqrt{x y}$. Равенство достигается, если $x=y$.  \\nСледовательно, правая часть данного неравенства состоит из суммы, где первое слагаемое неотрицательно, а второе слагаемое есть правая часть доказываемого неравенства.  \\nПоэтому очевидно, что $\\\\frac{x+y}{2}>\\\\sqrt{x y}$. Равенство достигается, если $x=y$.\\nВторой способ. Составим разность $\\\\frac{x+y}{2}-\\\\sqrt{x y}$ инайдем ее знак: $\\\\frac{x+y}{2}-\\\\sqrt{x y}=$ $=\\\\frac{x+y-2 \\\\sqrt{x y}}{2}=\\\\frac{(\\\\sqrt{x}-\\\\sqrt{y})^{2}}{2}$. Неравенство $(\\\\sqrt{x}-\\\\sqrt{y})^{2}>0$ верно при любых неотрицательных значениях $x$ и $y$. Значит $\\\\frac{x+y}{2}>\\\\sqrt{x y}$.  \\n---  \\nФормулировка неравенства $\\\\frac{x+y}{2}>\\\\sqrt{x y}$ : среднее арифметическое двух неотрицательных чисел не меньше среднего геометрического этих чисел. Это неравенство называют неравенством Коши.  \\nИз неравенства Коши следует неравенство $x+\\\\frac{1}{x}>2$.\\nВ самом деле $\\\\frac{x+\\\\frac{1}{x}}{2}>\\\\sqrt{x \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{x}}$ или $x+\\\\frac{1}{x}>2$.\\nПримечание. Можно доказать утверждение о том, что среднее арифметическое любого количества неотрицательных чисел не меньше среднего геометрического этих чисел, т. е. если числа $x_{1}, x_{2}, x_{3}, \\\\ldots, x_{n}$ неотрицательны, то\\n$\\\\frac{x_{1}+x_{3}+x_{3}+\\\\ldots+x_{n}}{n}>\\\\sqrt[3]{x_{1} x_{2} x_{3} \\\\cdot \\\\ldots \\\\cdot x_{n}}$, причем знак равенства возможен только при $x_{1}=x_{2}=\\\\ldots=x_{n}$.  \\n8. Докажем неравенство $1+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{4}}+\\\\ldots+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{n}}<$ $<2 \\\\sqrt{n}-1$ при $n>1$.\\nДоказательство. Выражение $\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{m}}$ можно представить следующим образом:  \\n$$\\n\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{m}}=\\\\frac{2}{2 \\\\sqrt{m}}=\\\\frac{2}{\\\\sqrt{m}+\\\\sqrt{m}}<\\\\frac{2}{\\\\sqrt{m}+\\\\sqrt{m-1}}, \\\\text { т. е. } \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{m}}<\\\\frac{2}{\\\\sqrt{m}+\\\\sqrt{m-1}}\\n$$  \\nСогласно последнему неравенству имеем:  \\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n& \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}<\\\\frac{2}{\\\\sqrt{2}+1} \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}}<\\\\frac{2}{\\\\sqrt{3}+\\\\sqrt{2}} \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{4}}<\\\\frac{2}{\\\\sqrt{4}+\\\\sqrt{3}} \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{n}}<\\\\frac{2}{\\\\sqrt{n}+\\\\sqrt{n-1}}\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$  \\nПочленно складывая эти неравенства получим:  \\n$$\\n\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{4}}+\\\\ldots+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{n}}<2\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}+1}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}+\\\\sqrt{2}}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{4}+\\\\sqrt{3}}+\\\\ldots+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{n}+\\\\sqrt{n-1}}\\\\right)\\n$$  \\nОсвободимся от иррациональности в знаменателях дробей правой части неравенства, умножая числитель и знаменатель каждой дроби на соответствующее сопряженное число. Тогда последнее неравенство можно записать так:  \\n$$\\n\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{4}}+\\\\ldots+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{n}}<2\\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{2}-1}{2-1}+\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{3}-\\\\sqrt{2}}{3-2}+\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{4}-\\\\sqrt{3}}{4-3}+\\\\ldots+\\\\frac{\\\\sqrt{n}-\\\\sqrt{n-1}}{n-(n-1)}\\\\right)\\n$$  \\n---  \\nили  \\n$$\\n\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{4}}+\\\\ldots+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{n}}<2(\\\\sqrt{2}-1+\\\\sqrt{3}-\\\\sqrt{2}+\\\\sqrt{4}-\\\\sqrt{3}+\\\\ldots+\\\\sqrt{n}-\\\\sqrt{n-1})\\n$$  \\nили  \\n$$\\n\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{4}}+\\\\ldots+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{n}}<2(-1+\\\\sqrt{n})\\n$$  \\nЕсли к обе им частям последнего неравенства прибавить 1 , то получится:  \\n$$\\n1+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{4}}+\\\\ldots+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{n}}<2(-1+\\\\sqrt{n})+1\\n$$  \\nили  \\n$$\\n1+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{3}}+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{4}}+\\\\ldots+\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{n}}<2 \\\\sqrt{n}-1\\n$$  \\n1.

Поменяв местами переменные $x$ и $y$ получим функцию $y=\\\\log _{x} x$. Эта функция является обратной функцией показательной функции.  \\nОпределение. Функиия, обратная показательной функиии, называется логарифмической функиией.  \\nЛогарифмическая функция имеет вид $y=\\\\log _{a} x$, где $a>0$ и $a \\\\neq 1$.\\nС помощью логарифмических функций выражаются многие зависимости, имеющие важное научно-практическое значение.  \\nНапример, формула:  \\n$$\\nh=\\\\frac{1}{k} \\\\ln \\\\frac{p_{0}}{p}\\n$$  \\n---  \\nгде $p_{0}$ - атмосферное давление над уровнем моря, $k$ - некоторая известная постоянная, $e \\\\approx 2,718, h$ - высота над уровнем моря, $p$ атмосферное давление на высоте $h$ над уровнем моря. Данная формула используется для определения высоты над уровнем моря.  \\nЗдесь $p$ - независимая переменная, или аргумент, а $h$ - зависимая переменная, или функция. По этой формуле можно определить высоту $h$ над уровнем моря по данному атмосферному давлению $p$ на этой высоте. Эту формулу можно получить, решив уравнение относительно $h$ :  \\n$$\\np=p_{0} e^{-k h}\\n$$  \\nили другая формула:  \\n$$\\nt=\\\\frac{100}{p} \\\\ln \\\\frac{A}{a}\\n$$  \\nобразовавшаяся при органическом росте вклада через $t$ лет, где $a$ обозначает первоначальный вклад; $p$ - число годовых процентов; $A$ - сумма.  \\nЗдесь $A$ можно рассматривать как независимую переменную, а $t$ как зависимую.

Существование касательной к графику функции в точке равносильно дифференцируемости функции в этой точке, поэтому показательная функция дифференцируема. График любой показательной функции проходит через точку $(0 ; 1)$.  \\nРассмотрим угол, образованный касательной к графику функции $y=a^{x}$ в точке $(0 ; 1)$ и положительным направлением оси $O x$. Величина этого угла зависит от значения $a$. Например, при $a=2$ он приблизительно равен $34^{2}$, а при $a=3$ равен $48^{2}$. Другими словами, с возрастанием $a$ от 2 до 3 угол, а значит и угловой коэффициент касательной к графику функции $y=a^{x}$ в точке $(0 ; 1)$ постепенно увеличивается от $\\\\operatorname{tg} 34^{2}$ до $\\\\operatorname{tg} 48^{2}$.  \\nСледовательно, можно предположить, что существует график такой показательной функции, для которого рассматриваемый угол равен $45^{2}$. Основанием этой функции является число $e$. Получаем показательную функцию $y=e^{x}$ (рис. 62.1).  \\nТаким образом, существует значение основания $a$, для которого график функции $y=a^{x}$ обладает следующим свойством: касательная к нему в точке $(1 ; 0)$ образует с положительным направлением оси $O x$ угол в $45^{\\\\circ}$. Этим самым выделяется функция $y=e^{x}$.  \\nУгловой коэффициент касательной к графику функции $y=e^{x}$ в точке $(0 ; 1)$ равен $\\\\operatorname{tg} 45^{\\\\circ}$, т. е. 1. Но он может быть выражен и иначе. Значению $x$ в точке $x_{0}=0$ дадим приращение $\\\\Delta x$. Соответствующее значение $\\\\Delta y$ будет равно $e^{\\\\Delta x}$.  \\nЧерез две точки $A(0 ; 1)$ и $B\\\\left(\\\\Delta x ; e^{\\\\Delta x}\\\\right)$ проведем секущую. Угол, образованный секущей и положительным направлением оси $O x$, обозначим через $\\\\beta$ (рис. 62.2).  \\nТогда имеем: $\\\\operatorname{tg} \\\\beta=\\\\frac{e^{\\\\Delta x}-1}{\\\\Delta x}$.\\nПри $\\\\Delta x \\\\rightarrow 0$ секущая стремится занять положение касательной к графику функции $y=e^{x}$ в точке $A(0 ; 1)$, и, следовательно,  \\n---  \\n$$\\n\\\\lim _{\\\\Delta x \\\\rightarrow 0} \\\\operatorname{tg} \\\\beta=\\\\lim _{\\\\Delta x \\\\rightarrow 0} \\\\frac{e^{\\\\Delta x}-1}{\\\\Delta x}=\\\\operatorname{tg} 45^{2}=1\\n$$  \\nТаким образом, мы получили важное равенство:  \\n$$\\n\\\\lim _{\\\\Delta x \\\\rightarrow 0} \\\\frac{e^{\\\\Delta x}-1}{\\\\Delta x}=1 \\\\text { или } \\\\lim _{x \\\\rightarrow 0} \\\\frac{e^{x}-1}{x}=1\\n$$  \\n![[алгебра 11 рус_p170_img90.jpeg]]\\n1)\\n![[алгебра 11 рус_p170_img91.jpeg]]\\n2)  \\nРис. 62\\nТеорема 1.

Найдем производную функции $y=f(x)$ :\\n1) $f(x)=7^{x} ;$\\n2) $f(x)=4^{-3 x}$.  \\nРешение. Для решения примеров используем формулу производной показательной функции (4) и формулу производной сложной функции. Тогда имеем:  \\n1) $\\\\left(7^{x}\\\\right)^{\\\\prime}=7 \\\\cdot \\\\ln 7$; 2) $\\\\left(4^{-3 x}\\\\right)^{\\\\prime}=4^{-3 x} \\\\cdot \\\\ln 4 \\\\cdot(-3 x)^{\\\\prime}=-3 \\\\cdot 4^{-3 x} \\\\ln 4$.  \\nOmвem: 1) $7 \\\\cdot \\\\ln 7$; 2) $-3 \\\\cdot 4^{-3 x} \\\\ln 4$.  \\n## ПРИМЕР  \\n3. Исследуем функцию $y=x e^{x}$ на возрастание, убывание и экстремум.  \\nРешение. Для этого найдем производную этой функции:\\n$y^{\\\\prime}=\\\\left(x e^{x}\\\\right)^{\\\\prime}=x^{\\\\prime} \\\\cdot e^{x}+x\\\\left(e^{x}\\\\right)^{\\\\prime}=e^{x}+x e^{x}=e^{x}(1+x)$ или $y^{\\\\prime}=e^{x}(1+x)$.\\nТак как $e^{x}>0$ для любого $x$, то знак $y^{\\\\prime}$ совпадает со знаком $1+x$. Следовательно, $y^{\\\\prime}>0$ на промежутке $(-1 ;+\\\\infty)$. Так как функция $y=x e^{x}$ непрерывна на $R$, значит она непрерывна и в точке $x=-1$. Следовательно, данная функция возрастает на промежутке $[-1 ;+\\\\infty)$. На промежутке $(-\\\\infty ;-1)$ имеем $y^{\\\\prime}<0$, поэтому функция убывает на промежутке $(-\\\\infty ;-1]$. В точке $x_{0}=-1$ производная равна 0 и в ее окрестности меняет знак с \"-\" на \"+\". Значит, точка $x_{0}=-1$ является точкой минимума.  \\nОтвет: функция возрастает на промежутке $[-1 ;+\\\\infty)$ и убывает на $(-\\\\infty ;-1], x=-1$ точка минимума.  \\n## (1)  \\nВы научитесь находить производную логарифмической функции.  \\nЧерез каждую точку графика показательной функции $y=a^{x}$ можно провести касательную, а существование касательной к графику функции означает ее дифференцируемость в каждой точке. Но функции $y=a^{x}$ и $y=\\\\log _{a} x$ взаимообратны, поэтому график логарифмической функции симметричен графику показательной функции относительно прямой $y=x$. Значит, функция $y=\\\\log _{a} x, a>0, a \\\\neq 1$ является непрерывной функцией. Тогда через каждую точку графика логарифмической функ-  \\n---  \\nции тоже можно провести касательную. Следовательно, логарифмическая функция дифференцируема в каждой точке области определения.  \\nПрежде чем вывести формулу производной логарифмической функции, рассмотрим производные взаимообратных функций.  \\nТеорема 3. Если функиии $f(x)$ и $g(x)$ взаимообратныи, и одна из них, допустим, функиия $f(x)$, илеет производную в точке $x_{0}$, отличную от нуля, то обратная ей функиия $g(x)$ также в точке $x_{0}$ имеет производную, отличную от нуля, равную обратной величине производной функиии $f(x), m . e$.  \\n$$\\ng^{\\\\prime}\\\\left(x_{0}\\\\right)=\\\\frac{1}{f^{\\\\prime}\\\\left(x_{0}\\\\right)}\\n$$  \\nДоказательство.  \\n$$\\ng^{\\\\prime}\\\\left(x_{0}\\\\right)=\\\\lim _{\\\\Delta y \\\\rightarrow 0} \\\\frac{\\\\Delta y}{\\\\Delta x}=\\\\lim _{\\\\Delta x \\\\rightarrow 0} \\\\frac{1}{\\\\frac{\\\\Delta y}{\\\\Delta x}}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\lim _{\\\\Delta x \\\\rightarrow 0} \\\\frac{\\\\Delta y}{\\\\Delta x}}=\\\\frac{1}{f^{\\\\prime}\\\\left(x_{0}\\\\right)}\\n$$  \\nЗначит, производная логарифмической функции находится по формуле  \\n$$\\n\\\\left(\\\\log _{a} x\\\\right)^{\\\\prime}=\\\\frac{1}{x \\\\ln a}\\n$$  \\nСамостоятельно доказать правильность формулы (6), используя соотношение производных взаимообратных функций (5).  \\nТак как $\\\\ln e=1$, то формула производной $y=\\\\ln x$ имеет вид:  \\n$$\\n(\\\\ln x)^{\\\\prime}=\\\\frac{1}{x}\\n$$  \\n4. Найдем производные функции $y=f(x)$ :\\n1) $f(x)=\\\\log _{1} x$; 2) $f(x)=\\\\ln (2+5 x)$.  \\nРешение. 1) По формуле производной логарифмической функции (6) имеем: $\\\\left(\\\\log _{\\\\frac{1}{3}} x\\\\right)^{\\\\prime}=\\\\frac{1}{x \\\\ln \\\\frac{1}{3}}$\\n2) Используя формулу (7) и формулу производной сложной функции получим: $(\\\\ln (2+5 x))^{\\\\prime}=\\\\frac{5}{2+5 x}$  \\n$$\\n\\\\text { Oтвет: 1) } \\\\frac{1}{x \\\\ln \\\\frac{1}{3}} \\\\text {; 2) } \\\\frac{5}{2+5 x}\\n$$  \\n## ПРИМЕР  \\n5. Исследуем функцию $y=x^{2} \\\\ln x$ на возрастание, убывание и найдем точки экстремума.\\nРешение. Используем алгоритм нахождения промежутков возрастания и убывания.

Определяя знак производной на полученных промежутках имеем: $y^{\\\\prime}>0$ на промежутке $\\\\left(\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{e}} ;+\\\\infty\\\\right)$ и поэтому функция на этом промежутке возрастает. На промежутке $\\\\left(0 ; \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{e}}\\\\right)$ производная отрицательна, поэтому функция на этом промежутке убывает. При переходе через точку $\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{e}}$ производная меняет знак с \"-\" на \"+\". Значит, в этой точке функция имеет минимум.  \\nОтвет: на промежутке $\\\\left(0 ; \\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{e}}\\\\right)$ функция убывает, на промежутке  \\n$$\\n\\\\left[\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{e}} ;+\\\\infty\\\\right] \\\\text { - возрастает, } x=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{e}} \\\\text { точка минимума. }\\n$$  \\n(1) Вы научитесь находить первообразную показательной функции.  \\nВыведенные формулы производных показательной и логарифмической функций позволяют получить следующие табличные интегралы:  \\n$$\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n& \\\\int e^{x} d x=e^{x}+C ; \\\\int a^{x} d x=\\\\frac{a^{x}}{\\\\ln a}+C \\\\\\\\\\n& \\\\int \\\\frac{1}{x} d x=\\\\ln |x|+C\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n$$  \\n6.

ЛОГАРИФМИЧЕСКИЕ НЕРАВЕНСТВА  \\nВы научитесь решать логарифмические неравенства.  \\nОпределение.

С другой стороны по второму закону Ньютона $F=m a$, где $a=v^{\\\\prime}$ - ускорение.  \\nЗначит, $m a=-k v$, или $v^{\\\\prime}=-\\\\frac{k}{m} v$. Решая полученное уравнение с разделяющимися переменными, находим $\\\\ln v=-\\\\frac{k t}{m}+C$, или $v=e^{-\\\\frac{k t}{m}+C}$.  \\nИспользуя начальные условия, что $v_{0}=20 \\\\mathrm{kм} /$ ч при $t=0$.

Решение. Из физики известно, что сила тока $I$ есть производная от количества электричества $q$, прошедшего через проводник, по времени $t . I=q^{\\\\prime}$.

Решение. Так как $a, b, c$ положительные и произведение больше $\\\\frac{1}{4}$, то $0<a<1,0<b<1,0<c<1$. Рассмотрим: $x(1-x)=x-x^{2}=-\\\\left(x^{2}-x\\\\right)=$  \\n---  \\n$=-\\\\left(x^{2}-2 \\\\cdot \\\\frac{1}{2} x+\\\\frac{1}{4}-\\\\frac{1}{4}\\\\right)=\\\\frac{1}{4}-\\\\left(x-\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\right)^{2}<\\\\frac{1}{4}$; т. е. $x(1-x)<\\\\frac{1}{4}$. Тогда справедливы неравенства: $a(1-a)<\\\\frac{1}{4} ; b(1-b)<\\\\frac{1}{4} ; c(1-c)<\\\\frac{1}{4}$. Если перемножить данные неравенства, то получим: $a(1-a) \\\\cdot b(1-b) \\\\cdot c(1-c)<\\\\frac{1}{64}$, или $a(1-b) \\\\cdot b(1-c) \\\\cdot c(1-a)<\\\\frac{1}{64}$. Следовательно, неравенство $a(1-b) \\\\cdot b(1-c) \\\\cdot c(1-a)>\\\\frac{1}{64}$ невозможно. Неравенства $a(1-b)>\\\\frac{1}{4} ; b(1-c)>\\\\frac{1}{4} ; c(1-a)>\\\\frac{1}{4}$ не могут выполняться одновременно. 79. Решение. Очевидно, что неравенство (1) $x^{2}+y^{2}>2 x y$, но т. к. $x \\\\neq y$, то $x^{2}+y^{2}>2 x y$. Умножим обе части неравенства на $a b(a b>0)$, получим $a b\\\\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\\\\right)>2 a b x y$ (2). Прибавим к обеим частям неравенства (2) выражение $\\\\left(a^{2}+b^{2}\\\\right) x y$, получим $\\\\left(a^{2}+b^{2}\\\\right) x y+a b\\\\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\\\\right)>\\\\left(a^{2}+b^{2}\\\\right) x y+$ $+2 a b x y$ или $\\\\left(a^{2}+b^{2}\\\\right) x y+a b\\\\left(x^{2}+y^{2}\\\\right)=a^{2} x y+b^{2} x y+a b x y^{2} a b y^{2}=a x(a y+b x)+b y(b x+a y)=$ $=(a y+b x)(a x+b y)$. Но выполняется равенство $\\\\left(a^{2}+b^{2}\\\\right) x y+2 a b x y=(a+b)^{2} x y$. Итак, $(a y+b x)(a x+b y)>(a+b)^{2} x y(3)$. Если $a+b>0$ и $a y+b x>0$, то, поделив неравенство (3) на $(a+b)(a y+b x)>0$, получим $\\\\frac{(a+b) x y}{a y+b x}<\\\\frac{a x+b y}{a+b}$. 80. Решение. Так как $\\\\frac{1}{a}+\\\\frac{1}{b}=\\\\frac{2}{c}$, то найдем $c=\\\\frac{2 a b}{a+b}$.  \\nТогда $\\\\frac{a+c}{a-c}=\\\\frac{a+\\\\frac{2 a b}{a+b}}{a-\\\\frac{2 a b}{a+b}}=\\\\frac{a^{2}+3 a b}{a^{2}-a b}=\\\\frac{a+3 b}{a-b}$, т. е. $\\\\frac{a+c}{a-c}=\\\\frac{a+3 b}{a-b}$\\nАналогично $\\\\frac{b+c}{b-c}=\\\\frac{b+\\\\frac{2 a b}{a+b}}{b-\\\\frac{2 a b}{a+b}}=\\\\frac{b^{2}+3 a b}{b^{2}-a b}=\\\\frac{b+3 a}{b-a}$, т. е. $\\\\frac{b+c}{b-c}=\\\\frac{b+3 a}{b-a}$\\nСкладывая равенства (1) и (2), получим $\\\\frac{a+c}{a-c}+\\\\frac{b+c}{b-c}=\\\\frac{a+3 b}{a-b}+\\\\frac{b+3 a}{b-a}=$ $=\\\\frac{2 a-2 b}{b-a}=-2$. 81. Нет. Решение. От прибавления или вычитания 1 меняется характер четкости числа. Таким образом, если 25 раз менять характер четкости числа 100 , то в результате получится нечетное число. Следовательно, число 80 получиться не может. 82. Решение. Пользуясь тем, что среднее геометрическое положительных чисел не больше среднего арифметического этих же чисел, получим: $\\\\sqrt[n]{n!}=\\\\sqrt[3]{1 \\\\cdot 2 \\\\cdot 3 \\\\cdot \\\\ldots \\\\cdot n}<\\\\frac{1+2+3+\\\\ldots+n}{n}=\\\\frac{(n+1) n}{2 n}=\\\\frac{n+1}{2}$. Возведя в $n$-ую степень обе части последнего неравенства, получим неравенство: $n!<\\\\left(\\\\frac{n+1}{2}\\\\right)^{n}, n>2.83 .1)$ (2) $(1 ; 3) .84 .(-\\\\infty ;-\\\\sqrt{2}] \\\\cup[\\\\sqrt{2} ;+\\\\infty)$. Решение. Учитывая, что $3 x^{2}+2>1$, решим первое неравенство: $x^{2}-3 x+7>3 x^{2}+2$ или $2 x^{2}+3 x-5<0$, т. е. $-2,5<x<1$. Решим второе неравенство относительно $(x+1)$. Корни уравнения $(x+1)^{2}-4 a^{2}(x+1)+3 a^{4}=0$ равны $a^{2}$ и $3 a^{2}$. Следовательно, $x+1<a^{2}$ или $x+1>3 a^{2}$. Значит, $x<a^{2}-1$ или $x>3 a^{2}-1$. Множество решений первого неравенства должно попасть в множество решений второго неравенства. Следовательно, должны выполняться неравенства $a^{2}-1>1$ или $3 a^{2}-1<-2,5$. Решением второго неравенства является пустое множество, а решением первого неравенства является множество $-(-\\\\infty ;-\\\\sqrt{2}] \\\\cup[\\\\sqrt{2} ;+\\\\infty) .85 . \\\\frac{1+\\\\sqrt{10}}{2}$. 86. $4<a<5.87$. 1) $1 ; 2) 2 \\\\pi ; 3) 2,25 \\\\pi$.  \\n---'),\n",
