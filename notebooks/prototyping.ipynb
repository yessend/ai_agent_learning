It is provided in a numbered list (1 to 6), where each item in the list corresponds to a summary.\\n---------------------\\n(1) The goal of this course is to equip students with the knowledge and skills necessary to   read, analyze, and interpret financial accounting information to make informed   business decisions.   To obtain this goal, the course will (1) describe the four major financial statements   companies use to communicate financial accounting information to stakeholders; (2)   introduce the mechanics of financial accounting; (3) provide a foundational   understanding of common methods of financial statement analysis, and (4) present   concepts that govern the treatment of central topics in financial accounting.   The course will introduce the concepts using generally accepted accounting principles in   the US (US GAAP) and around the world (IFRS).   The course is oriented toward those who are or will be users, rather than prepares, of   financial accounting information. Hence, the focus will be on teaching the skills needed   to apply financial accounting knowledge in order to understand the effects of various   transactions and events on financial statements, and evaluate a firm\\'s financial position   and performance. Topics covered in this course are essential for everyone who seeks to   become an informed user of financial accounting information (e.g., for consulting,\\n\\n(2) Loosely speaking, finance is the analytical study of the flow of ”goods” exchanged in the financial system, with the purpose of making good decisions. That is,   Mathematics and Statistics + Money := Finance   1 Time is Money (Impatience Principle) - All else equal, individuals prefer   money now to later.   2 Non-Satiation - All else equal, individuals prefer more money than less   money.   3 Risk Aversion - All else equal, individuals require a compensation for   bearing risk.   4 Financial Free Lunches do not exists - In the market, there is no   possibility of making money out of nowhere and without facing any risk.   5 All agents act in their own self interest - The individuals maximize their   own profit without caring of the consequences for the other agents.   6 Financial Market Prices Shift to Equalize Supply and Demand   7 Financial Market are competitive, highly adaptive   Course Learning Outcomes:   1 CILO1: Explain foundational theories and concepts in finance and the   structure and functioning of global capital markets. (Theory)   2 CILO2: Apply the basic principles of valuations and use them to take   informed managerial decisions. (Practice)   3 CILO3: Express the appropriate technical financial jargon to\\n\\n(3) The central objective of this course is to provide students with an overview of the field of management with a focus on managing organizations. This objective will be accomplished by introducing participants to the core elements of management and organizations. This class interactions will entail the use of such pedagogical tools as: case studies, field-research, interactive in-class exercises, critical thinking, literature review, industry talks and movies.   At the end of the program, the students should be able to:   - Analyze organization through appropriate theoretical lenses of Organization Science   - Understand and analyze how managers make decisions towards organizational efficiency and efficacy.   - Understand, Analyze and Participate in Management Processes (i.e. Planning, Organizing, Leading, Controlling)\\n\\n(4) This course is designed to provide an in-depth exploration of strategic marketing and   consumer behavior. It focuses on understanding marketing decision-making   processes within the context of a constantly changing business environment,   influenced by customers, competitors, technology, and external regulatory factors.   You will be expected to approach these challenges from the perspective of a   marketing manager, making decisions on product strategies, distribution, pricing,   and promotion to achieve organizational goals.   A significant part of the course will delve into consumer behavior, applying   behavioral theories to understand how individuals make consumption decisions.   Consumer behavior is a continuous process shaped by a range of internal   psychological factors—such as motivation, personality, perception, and lifestyle—and   external influences including culture, social class, and reference groups. This study   helps explain how consumers’ self-concept, experiences, and environment influence   their choices, purchase decisions, and brand loyalty.   Through a combination of theory and practical application, the course will provide   you with a systematic framework for understanding both marketing strategy and   consumer behavior. We will examine how marketing strategies can be crafted to   effectively engage and persuade consumers, fostering long-term relationships and   customer value.   The objectives of the course are to:   • Familiarize you with the challenges faced by marketing managers in a rapidly   changing environment.   • Enable you to apply analytical tools and behavioral theories to solve marketing   problems.   • Enhance your decision-making skills through a sound understanding of both   strategic marketing frameworks and consumer behavior influences.   • Develop critical problem-solving attitudes and habits necessary for effective   management across various organizations.   Throughout the course, a combination of lectures, case studies, and class discussion   will provide opportunities to apply these concepts, enhancing your capacity to think\\n\\n(5) This course is designed to address the needs of students who hope to pursue startup opportunities, join a new venture as early employees, lead new ventures in established firms, or pursue careers where the ability to evaluate startups would be helpful (e.g., venture capital, mergers and acquisitions).   It provides students with tools and information for evaluating entrepreneurial projects, negotiating with business partners, and developing strategies for starting their ventures. The tools and information apply to many challenges that inevitably emerge in various aspects of entrepreneurship. For example, how will you find out if the value proposition of your startup is as appealing as you assumed (whether the venture’s product/service will sell)? How to capture the value created by your venture while some resourceful and powerful competitors may easily imitate your idea? How to seize funding opportunities from venture capitalists? What business model should you adopt? How do you assemble a founding team together? Many of these early decisions will have enduring impact on a venture’s subsequent performance and even survival chance.   The objectives of the course:\\n\\n(6) The Strategy (or Strategic Management or Competitive Strategy) course will focus on formulating and implementing business and corporate strategy to achieve superior performance. Successful business policies require a detailed understanding of the overall environment and the ability to create value for customers in the face of competition. Successful business policies also require analytical and administrative capabilities. The best analysis in the world will not lead to corporate success if it cannot be turned into actionable strategies that can be successfully implemented. Similarly, the best administrator in the world will not be able to help a firm with the wrong strategy to achieve peak performance.   The purpose of the course in strategy is to make participants familiar with the core concepts and techniques that function as foundations for formulating and implementing successful strategies. However, its basic intent is not on mastering specific analytical tools but rather on using strategic thinking and the development of a managerial attitude to guide actions in the face of uncertainty and complexity. So the main focus of the course is to learn how to use and apply these skills when judging complex management situations.   The distinctive contribution of the strategy course is that it integrates the different perspectives that you have already learned and allows you to apply these perspectives to complex and realistic general management situations. By learning to view the business from a holistic perspective, you will develop your ability to think beyond the day-to-day business activities and your ability to ask the right questions about the future of the business. Those skills, more than any other, will make you an effective general manager. The ultimate goal of this course is therefore to develop your judgment as a general manager.\\n---------------------\\nUsing only the choices above and not prior knowledge, return the top choice(s) (no more than 3) that are most relevant to the question: \\'What are the differences between Financial and Managerial accounting?\\'\\nYour response MUST be ONLY a valid JSON list of objects, where each object has a \\'choice\\' (integer) and \\'reason\\' (string) key.

To obtain this goal, the course will (1) describe the four major financial statements   companies use to communicate financial accounting information to stakeholders; (2)   introduce the mechanics of financial accounting; (3) provide a foundational   understanding of common methods of financial statement analysis, and (4) present   concepts that govern the treatment of central topics in financial accounting.   The course will introduce the concepts using generally accepted accounting principles in   the US (US GAAP) and around the world (IFRS).   The course is oriented toward those who are or will be users, rather than prepares, of   financial accounting information. Hence, the focus will be on teaching the skills needed   to apply financial accounting knowledge in order to understand the effects of various   transactions and events on financial statements, and evaluate a firm\\'s financial position   and performance. Topics covered in this course are essential for everyone who seeks to   become an informed user of financial accounting information (e.g., for consulting,\\n\\n(2) Loosely speaking, finance is the analytical study of the flow of ”goods” exchanged in the financial system, with the purpose of making good decisions. That is,   Mathematics and Statistics + Money := Finance   1 Time is Money (Impatience Principle) - All else equal, individuals prefer   money now to later.   2 Non-Satiation - All else equal, individuals prefer more money than less   money.   3 Risk Aversion - All else equal, individuals require a compensation for   bearing risk.   4 Financial Free Lunches do not exists - In the market, there is no   possibility of making money out of nowhere and without facing any risk.   5 All agents act in their own self interest - The individuals maximize their   own profit without caring of the consequences for the other agents.   6 Financial Market Prices Shift to Equalize Supply and Demand   7 Financial Market are competitive, highly adaptive   Course Learning Outcomes:   1 CILO1: Explain foundational theories and concepts in finance and the   structure and functioning of global capital markets. (Theory)   2 CILO2: Apply the basic principles of valuations and use them to take   informed managerial decisions. (Practice)   3 CILO3: Express the appropriate technical financial jargon to\\n\\n(3) The central objective of this course is to provide students with an overview of the field of management with a focus on managing organizations. This objective will be accomplished by introducing participants to the core elements of management and organizations. This class interactions will entail the use of such pedagogical tools as: case studies, field-research, interactive in-class exercises, critical thinking, literature review, industry talks and movies.   At the end of the program, the students should be able to:   - Analyze organization through appropriate theoretical lenses of Organization Science   - Understand and analyze how managers make decisions towards organizational efficiency and efficacy.   - Understand, Analyze and Participate in Management Processes (i.e. Planning, Organizing, Leading, Controlling)\\n\\n(4) This course is designed to provide an in-depth exploration of strategic marketing and   consumer behavior. It focuses on understanding marketing decision-making   processes within the context of a constantly changing business environment,   influenced by customers, competitors, technology, and external regulatory factors.   You will be expected to approach these challenges from the perspective of a   marketing manager, making decisions on product strategies, distribution, pricing,   and promotion to achieve organizational goals.   A significant part of the course will delve into consumer behavior, applying   behavioral theories to understand how individuals make consumption decisions.   Consumer behavior is a continuous process shaped by a range of internal   psychological factors—such as motivation, personality, perception, and lifestyle—and   external influences including culture, social class, and reference groups. This study   helps explain how consumers’ self-concept, experiences, and environment influence   their choices, purchase decisions, and brand loyalty.   Through a combination of theory and practical application, the course will provide   you with a systematic framework for understanding both marketing strategy and   consumer behavior. We will examine how marketing strategies can be crafted to   effectively engage and persuade consumers, fostering long-term relationships and   customer value.   The objectives of the course are to:   • Familiarize you with the challenges faced by marketing managers in a rapidly   changing environment.   • Enable you to apply analytical tools and behavioral theories to solve marketing   problems.   • Enhance your decision-making skills through a sound understanding of both   strategic marketing frameworks and consumer behavior influences.   • Develop critical problem-solving attitudes and habits necessary for effective   management across various organizations.   Throughout the course, a combination of lectures, case studies, and class discussion   will provide opportunities to apply these concepts, enhancing your capacity to think\\n\\n(5) This course is designed to address the needs of students who hope to pursue startup opportunities, join a new venture as early employees, lead new ventures in established firms, or pursue careers where the ability to evaluate startups would be helpful (e.g., venture capital, mergers and acquisitions).   It provides students with tools and information for evaluating entrepreneurial projects, negotiating with business partners, and developing strategies for starting their ventures. The tools and information apply to many challenges that inevitably emerge in various aspects of entrepreneurship. For example, how will you find out if the value proposition of your startup is as appealing as you assumed (whether the venture’s product/service will sell)? How to capture the value created by your venture while some resourceful and powerful competitors may easily imitate your idea? How to seize funding opportunities from venture capitalists? What business model should you adopt? How do you assemble a founding team together? Many of these early decisions will have enduring impact on a venture’s subsequent performance and even survival chance.   The objectives of the course:\\n\\n(6) The Strategy (or Strategic Management or Competitive Strategy) course will focus on formulating and implementing business and corporate strategy to achieve superior performance. Successful business policies require a detailed understanding of the overall environment and the ability to create value for customers in the face of competition. Successful business policies also require analytical and administrative capabilities. The best analysis in the world will not lead to corporate success if it cannot be turned into actionable strategies that can be successfully implemented. Similarly, the best administrator in the world will not be able to help a firm with the wrong strategy to achieve peak performance.   The purpose of the course in strategy is to make participants familiar with the core concepts and techniques that function as foundations for formulating and implementing successful strategies. However, its basic intent is not on mastering specific analytical tools but rather on using strategic thinking and the development of a managerial attitude to guide actions in the face of uncertainty and complexity. So the main focus of the course is to learn how to use and apply these skills when judging complex management situations.   The distinctive contribution of the strategy course is that it integrates the different perspectives that you have already learned and allows you to apply these perspectives to complex and realistic general management situations. By learning to view the business from a holistic perspective, you will develop your ability to think beyond the day-to-day business activities and your ability to ask the right questions about the future of the business. Those skills, more than any other, will make you an effective general manager. The ultimate goal of this course is therefore to develop your judgment as a general manager.\\n---------------------\\nUsing only the choices above and not prior knowledge, return the top choice(s) (no more than 3) that are most relevant to the question: \\'What are the differences between Financial and Managerial accounting?\\'\\nYour response MUST be ONLY a valid JSON list of objects, where each object has a \\'choice\\' (integer) and \\'reason\\' (string) key.

To obtain this goal, the course will (1) describe the four major financial statements   companies use to communicate financial accounting information to stakeholders; (2)   introduce the mechanics of financial accounting; (3) provide a foundational   understanding of common methods of financial statement analysis, and (4) present   concepts that govern the treatment of central topics in financial accounting.   The course will introduce the concepts using generally accepted accounting principles in   the US (US GAAP) and around the world (IFRS).   The course is oriented toward those who are or will be users, rather than prepares, of   financial accounting information. Hence, the focus will be on teaching the skills needed   to apply financial accounting knowledge in order to understand the effects of various   transactions and events on financial statements, and evaluate a firm\\'s financial position   and performance.

This objective will be accomplished by introducing participants to the core elements of management and organizations. This class interactions will entail the use of such pedagogical tools as: case studies, field-research, interactive in-class exercises, critical thinking, literature review, industry talks and movies.   At the end of the program, the students should be able to:   - Analyze organization through appropriate theoretical lenses of Organization Science   - Understand and analyze how managers make decisions towards organizational efficiency and efficacy.   - Understand, Analyze and Participate in Management Processes (i.e. Planning, Organizing, Leading, Controlling)\\n\\n(4) This course is designed to provide an in-depth exploration of strategic marketing and   consumer behavior. It focuses on understanding marketing decision-making   processes within the context of a constantly changing business environment,   influenced by customers, competitors, technology, and external regulatory factors.   You will be expected to approach these challenges from the perspective of a   marketing manager, making decisions on product strategies, distribution, pricing,   and promotion to achieve organizational goals.   A significant part of the course will delve into consumer behavior, applying   behavioral theories to understand how individuals make consumption decisions.   Consumer behavior is a continuous process shaped by a range of internal   psychological factors—such as motivation, personality, perception, and lifestyle—and   external influences including culture, social class, and reference groups. This study   helps explain how consumers’ self-concept, experiences, and environment influence   their choices, purchase decisions, and brand loyalty.   Through a combination of theory and practical application, the course will provide   you with a systematic framework for understanding both marketing strategy and   consumer behavior. We will examine how marketing strategies can be crafted to   effectively engage and persuade consumers, fostering long-term relationships and   customer value.   The objectives of the course are to:   • Familiarize you with the challenges faced by marketing managers in a rapidly   changing environment.   • Enable you to apply analytical tools and behavioral theories to solve marketing   problems.   • Enhance your decision-making skills through a sound understanding of both   strategic marketing frameworks and consumer behavior influences.   • Develop critical problem-solving attitudes and habits necessary for effective   management across various organizations.   Throughout the course, a combination of lectures, case studies, and class discussion   will provide opportunities to apply these concepts, enhancing your capacity to think\\n\\n(5) This course is designed to address the needs of students who hope to pursue startup opportunities, join a new venture as early employees, lead new ventures in established firms, or pursue careers where the ability to evaluate startups would be helpful (e.g., venture capital, mergers and acquisitions).   It provides students with tools and information for evaluating entrepreneurial projects, negotiating with business partners, and developing strategies for starting their ventures. The tools and information apply to many challenges that inevitably emerge in various aspects of entrepreneurship. For example, how will you find out if the value proposition of your startup is as appealing as you assumed (whether the venture’s product/service will sell)? How to capture the value created by your venture while some resourceful and powerful competitors may easily imitate your idea? How to seize funding opportunities from venture capitalists? What business model should you adopt? How do you assemble a founding team together? Many of these early decisions will have enduring impact on a venture’s subsequent performance and even survival chance.   The objectives of the course:\\n\\n(6) The Strategy (or Strategic Management or Competitive Strategy) course will focus on formulating and implementing business and corporate strategy to achieve superior performance. Successful business policies require a detailed understanding of the overall environment and the ability to create value for customers in the face of competition. Successful business policies also require analytical and administrative capabilities. The best analysis in the world will not lead to corporate success if it cannot be turned into actionable strategies that can be successfully implemented. Similarly, the best administrator in the world will not be able to help a firm with the wrong strategy to achieve peak performance.   The purpose of the course in strategy is to make participants familiar with the core concepts and techniques that function as foundations for formulating and implementing successful strategies. However, its basic intent is not on mastering specific analytical tools but rather on using strategic thinking and the development of a managerial attitude to guide actions in the face of uncertainty and complexity. So the main focus of the course is to learn how to use and apply these skills when judging complex management situations.   The distinctive contribution of the strategy course is that it integrates the different perspectives that you have already learned and allows you to apply these perspectives to complex and realistic general management situations. By learning to view the business from a holistic perspective, you will develop your ability to think beyond the day-to-day business activities and your ability to ask the right questions about the future of the business. Those skills, more than any other, will make you an effective general manager. The ultimate goal of this course is therefore to develop your judgment as a general manager.\\n---------------------\\nUsing only the choices above and not prior knowledge, return the top choice(s) (no more than 3) that are most relevant to the question: \\'What about the theory of management, what frameworks are popular?\\'\\nYour response MUST be ONLY a valid JSON list of objects, where each object has a \\'choice\\' (integer) and \\'reason\\' (string) key.

It focuses on understanding marketing decision-making   processes within the context of a constantly changing business environment,   influenced by customers, competitors, technology, and external regulatory factors.   You will be expected to approach these challenges from the perspective of a   marketing manager, making decisions on product strategies, distribution, pricing,   and promotion to achieve organizational goals.   A significant part of the course will delve into consumer behavior, applying   behavioral theories to understand how individuals make consumption decisions.   Consumer behavior is a continuous process shaped by a range of internal   psychological factors—such as motivation, personality, perception, and lifestyle—and   external influences including culture, social class, and reference groups. This study   helps explain how consumers’ self-concept, experiences, and environment influence   their choices, purchase decisions, and brand loyalty.   Through a combination of theory and practical application, the course will provide   you with a systematic framework for understanding both marketing strategy and   consumer behavior. We will examine how marketing strategies can be crafted to   effectively engage and persuade consumers, fostering long-term relationships and   customer value.   The objectives of the course are to:   • Familiarize you with the challenges faced by marketing managers in a rapidly   changing environment.   • Enable you to apply analytical tools and behavioral theories to solve marketing   problems.   • Enhance your decision-making skills through a sound understanding of both   strategic marketing frameworks and consumer behavior influences.   • Develop critical problem-solving attitudes and habits necessary for effective   management across various organizations.   Throughout the course, a combination of lectures, case studies, and class discussion   will provide opportunities to apply these concepts, enhancing your capacity to think\\n\\n(5) This course is designed to address the needs of students who hope to pursue startup opportunities, join a new venture as early employees, lead new ventures in established firms, or pursue careers where the ability to evaluate startups would be helpful (e.g., venture capital, mergers and acquisitions).   It provides students with tools and information for evaluating entrepreneurial projects, negotiating with business partners, and developing strategies for starting their ventures. The tools and information apply to many challenges that inevitably emerge in various aspects of entrepreneurship. For example, how will you find out if the value proposition of your startup is as appealing as you assumed (whether the venture’s product/service will sell)? How to capture the value created by your venture while some resourceful and powerful competitors may easily imitate your idea? How to seize funding opportunities from venture capitalists? What business model should you adopt? How do you assemble a founding team together? Many of these early decisions will have enduring impact on a venture’s subsequent performance and even survival chance.   The objectives of the course:\\n\\n(6) The Strategy (or Strategic Management or Competitive Strategy) course will focus on formulating and implementing business and corporate strategy to achieve superior performance. Successful business policies require a detailed understanding of the overall environment and the ability to create value for customers in the face of competition. Successful business policies also require analytical and administrative capabilities. The best analysis in the world will not lead to corporate success if it cannot be turned into actionable strategies that can be successfully implemented. Similarly, the best administrator in the world will not be able to help a firm with the wrong strategy to achieve peak performance.   The purpose of the course in strategy is to make participants familiar with the core concepts and techniques that function as foundations for formulating and implementing successful strategies. However, its basic intent is not on mastering specific analytical tools but rather on using strategic thinking and the development of a managerial attitude to guide actions in the face of uncertainty and complexity. So the main focus of the course is to learn how to use and apply these skills when judging complex management situations.   The distinctive contribution of the strategy course is that it integrates the different perspectives that you have already learned and allows you to apply these perspectives to complex and realistic general management situations. By learning to view the business from a holistic perspective, you will develop your ability to think beyond the day-to-day business activities and your ability to ask the right questions about the future of the business. Those skills, more than any other, will make you an effective general manager. The ultimate goal of this course is therefore to develop your judgment as a general manager.\\n---------------------\\nUsing only the choices above and not prior knowledge, return the top choice(s) (no more than 3) that are most relevant to the question: \\'What we were talking about?\\'\\nYour response MUST be ONLY a valid JSON list of objects, where each object has a \\'choice\\' (integer) and \\'reason\\' (string) key.

Because the beta of  a portfolio is the weighted-average of  the betas of  \\nthe securities in the portfolio, we have a similar expression for the firm’s asset or unlevered \\nbeta, which we can use to estimate the beta of  our project:\\nAsset or Unlevered Beta\\n bU = E\\nE + D bE + D\\nE + D bD ( 12.9)\\nLet’s apply these formulas in an example.\\nEXAMPLE 12. 5 Unlevering the Cost of Capital\\nProblem\\nYour firm is considering expanding its household products division. You identify Procter & \\nGamble (PG) as a firm with comparable investments. Suppose PG’s equity has a market capital-\\nization of  $144 billion and a beta of  0.55. PG also has $37 billion of  AA-rated debt outstanding, \\nwith an average yield of  3.1%. Estimate the cost of  capital of  your firm’s investment given a risk-\\nfree rate of  3% and a market risk-premium of  5%.\\nSolution\\nBecause investing in this division is like investing in PG’s assets by holding its debt and equity, we \\ncan estimate our cost of  capital based on PG’s unlevered cost of  capital. First, we estimate PG’s \\nequity cost of  capital using the CAPM as rE = 3% + 0.55(5%) = 5.75%. Because PG’s debt \\nis highly rated, we approximate its debt cost of  capital using the debt yield of  3.1%. Thus, PG’s \\nunlevered cost of  capital is\\nrU = 144\\n144 + 37 5.75% + 37\\n144 + 37 3.1% = 5.21%\\nAlternatively, we can estimate PG’s unlevered beta. Given its high rating, if  we assume PG’s \\ndebt beta is zero we have\\nbU = 144\\n144 + 37 0.55 + 37\\n144 + 37 0 = 0.438\\nTaking this result as an estimate of  the beta of  our project, we can compute our project’s cost of  \\ncapital from the CAPM as rU = 3% + 0.438(5%) = 5.19%.\\nThe slight difference in rU  using the two methods arises because in the first case, we assumed \\nthe expected return of  PG’s debt is equal to its promised yield of  3.1% (which overestimates the \\ncost of  debt, as we pointed out in Section 12.4), while in the second case, we assumed the debt \\nhas a beta of  zero, which implies an expected return equal to the risk-free rate of  3% according to \\nthe CAPM (which underestimates the cost of  debt, because PG’s debt is not risk free). The truth \\nis somewhere between the two results.\\n14 For simplicity, we assume here that the firm in question maintains a constant debt-equity ratio, so that \\nthe weights E/(E + D ) and D/(E + D ) are fixed. As a result, Eq. 12.8 and Eq. 12.9 hold even in the pres-\\nence of  taxes. See Chapter 18 for details and an analysis of  settings with a changing leverage ratio.\\nM12_BERK4151_05_GE_C12.indd   458 01/04/19   6:46 AM\\nFrancesco Rocciolo (NUGSB) POF January 29, 2025 24 / 33\"\"\"\\n\"f4bfff54-24eb-465e-9385-51be1c9e98c3\": \"\"\"Market Capitalization = Share price * shares outstanding\\nLargest stock markets worldwide\\n26\\nhttps://www.statista.com/statistics/710680/global-stock-markets-by-country/\\nOver 50% of worldwide market capitalization in the US. \\nChapter1\\nMarket capitalization for US is 59 trillion USD (updated).\\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_stock_market_capitalization\"\"\"\\n\"4944c8a0-4aa6-4ada-a61e-0c4a316994da\": \"\"\"Wrap-up\\n49\\nChapter1\\nMarket-to-Book ratio•Market price (i.e., market capitalization), from stock market•Book value(i.e., shareholder equity), frombalancesheet(BS)Price-to-earnings ratio•Share price, from stock market•Earnings per share (can be GAAP and non-GAAP earnings), from income statement (IS)Earnings surprise•Forecasted earnings (per share)•Actual earnings (per share)\\nCalculate net income (after tax)•Revenue•Expense (e.g., cost of goods sold or COGS, depreciation)•Net income (NI)\"\"\"\\n\"177fc5fc-cf45-4b64-b0cd-aaba62b5ef13\": \"\"\"Patents make a difference.129\\nChapter2How have revenues evolved for Pfizer?\\nShare priceRevenues\\nPatent\"\"\"\\n\"fad24cc7-4c44-408f-87bf-c7dce12201b9\": \"\"\"How likely is it to lose money in the stock market.\\n52\\nChapter1\\nHow many people are invested in the stock market?\"\"\"\\n\"373b8738-071c-40a6-a6ad-190674766ae4\": \"\"\"133\\nChapter2How is AbbVie doing?\\nShare PriceRevenues\\nPatent\"\"\"\\n        ', completion='```json\\n[\"f4bfff54-24eb-465e-9385-51be1c9e98c3\", \"4944c8a0-4aa6-4ada-a61e-0c4a316994da\"]\\n```', completion_token_count=73, prompt_token_count=2588, total_token_count=2661, event_id='b44a76b4-3172-4707-8bd9-10667e98bbc5'),\n",
